# Basic Algorithms Interpetation

## General Information
It's terminal based program collectin few basic algorithms: BubbleSort, CombSort, SelectSort and few others. 
Also algorithms-based tasks such as zigzak text, spiralmatrix, counting median or finding in matrix three numbers adding itself to zero are added.
All those function can be used from switch-based menu.

It implements the Strategy Plan, exception usage, random numbers generation and hierachy of files by using packages.

## Technologies Used
- It was written in Oracle open JDK version 21.0.2 using Intellij Idea.

## Project Status
The field I think is worth developing is the exceptions usage, because in this project its mostly controlling if the user provided right variables (string instead of int etc)
But besides that, all of the functions are working properly so i consider it finished.

## Acknowledgements
Project structure was planned by my teacher.
